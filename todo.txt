- page doesn't refresh when manually adding participant as admin

- admins can manually add participants
- admins can remove participants

- add event table
    > add mandatory event_id as foreign key for tournaments

- add event selection to header
    > provides new EventContext
    > ALWAYS one selected
    > tournament overview page shows only tournaments with event in context
    > creating tournament creates in event in context

(- make it possible to change event in tournament admin settings (dropdown)) --- probably unnecessary

- group tournaments by category in main tournament overview
    > add quick selection dropdown to category input in tournament admin page, where it displays existing categories (from all tournaments or only same event?)

- normal users should be able to go to unpublished tournament pages (tournaments/14/details etc.)

- add feedback when registering / deregistering / adding participant as admin / removing participant as admin

- show tournament name title as fixed element overarching all tabs in tournament

- refactor tournament card into own component

- add tournament registrationGroup field (string)

    > show reason why they can not register for others
    > this also applies to team tournaments when being member in team
    > add registrationGroup input to admin page
        > with quick selection dropdown showing existing registrationGroups in same event

- general admin page to
    > see all users
    > add users
    > edit users
    > delete users
    > see all events
    > add events
    > edit events
    > delete events

- add state to tournament (registration_closed, registration_open, running, finished)
    > make registering only possible in registration_open

- max participants 0 means no limit (is default)
- make min participants default = 2

- make tournament details look nicer
    > take current page as template

- teams & team tournaments
    > teams are tournament-specific
    > an existing team is also a registered participant
    > creating a team also automatically creates a Tournament_Participant entry
    > participant list should show team name and members
    > join team via invite link (?) or password (?)
